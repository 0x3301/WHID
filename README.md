## Possible Applications ##

- Classic: Remote Keystrokes Injection Over WiFi

Deploy WHID on Victim's machine and remotely control it by  accessing its WiFi AP SSID. (eventually you can also setup WHID to connect to an existing WiFi network)

- Social Engineering: Deploy WHID inside an USB-enable gadget

The main idea behind it is to test for Social Engineering weaknesses within your target organization (e.g. DLP policy violations) and to bypass phisical access restrictions to Target's device.
Usually, I create a fancy brochure (sample template https://github.com/whid-injector/WHID/tree/master/tools/Social_Engineering_Lures ) attached with a weaponized USB gadget and then use a common delivery carrier (e.g. UPS, DHL, FedEx).
